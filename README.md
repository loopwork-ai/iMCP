## Getting Started

### Download and open the app

First, [download the iMCP app](https://iMCP.app/download)
(requires macOS 15.3 or later).

<img align="right" width="344" src="/Assets/imcp-screenshot-first-launch.png" alt="Screenshot of iMCP on first launch" />

When you open the app,
you'll see a
<img style="display: inline" width="20" height="16" src="/Assets/icon.svg" />
icon in your menu bar.

Clicking on this icon reveals the iMCP menu,
which displays all available services.
Initially, all services will appear in gray,
indicating they're inactive.

The blue toggle switch at the top indicates that the MCP server is running
and ready to connect with MCP-compatible clients.

<br clear="all">

<img align="right" width="372" src="/Assets/imcp-screenshot-grant-permission.png" alt="Screenshot of macOS permission dialog" />

### Activate services

To activate a service, click on its icon.
The system will prompt you with a permission dialog.
For example, when activating Calendar access, you'll see a dialog asking `"iMCP" Would Like Full Access to Your Calendar`.
Click <kbd>Allow Full Access</kbd> to continue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> iMCP **does not** collect or store any of your data.
> Clients like Claude Desktop _do_ send
> your data off device as part of tool calls.

<br clear="all">

<img align="right" width="344" src="/Assets/imcp-screenshot-all-services-active.png" alt="Screenshot of iMCP with all services enabled" />

Once activated,
each service icons goes from gray to their distinctive colors â€”
red for Calendar, green for Messages, blue for Location, and so on.

Repeat this process for all of the capabilities you'd like to enable.
These permissions follow Apple's standard security model,
giving you complete control over what information iMCP can access.

<br clear="all">

### Connect to Claude Desktop

If you don't have Claude Desktop installed,
you can [download it here](https://claude.ai/download).

Open Claude Desktop and go to "Settings... (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd><kbd>,</kbd>)".
Click on "Developer" in the sidebar of the Settings pane,
and then click on "Edit Config".
This will create a configuration file at
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

<br/>

To connect iMCP to Claude Desktop,
click <img style="display: inline" width="20" height="16" src="/Assets/icon.svg" />
\> "Configure Claude Desktop".

This will add or update the MCP server configuration to use the
`imcp-server` executable bundled in the application.
Other MCP server configurations in the file will be preserved.

<details>
<summary>You can also configure Claude Desktop manually</summary>

Click <img style="display: inline" width="20" height="16" src="/Assets/icon.svg" />
\> "Copy server command to clipboard".
Then open `claude_desktop_config.json` in your editor
and enter the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers" : {
    "iMCP" : {
      "command" : "{paste iMCP server command}"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

<img align="right" width="372" src="/Assets/imcp-screenshot-approve-connection.png" />

### Call iMCP tools from Claude Desktop

Quit and reopen the Claude Desktop app.
You'll be prompted to approve the connection.

> [!NOTE]
> You may see this dialog twice;
> click approve both times.

<br clear="all">

After approving the connection,
you should now see ðŸ”¨12 in the bottom right corner of your chat box.
Click on that to see a list of all the tools made available to Claude
by iMCP.

<p align="center">
  <img width="694" src="/Assets/claude-desktop-screenshot-tools-enabled.png" alt="Screenshot of Claude Desktop with tools enabled" />
</p>

Now you can ask Claude questions that require access to your personal data,
such as:
> "How's the weather where I am?"

Claude will use the appropriate tools to retrieve this information,
providing you with accurate, personalized responses
without requiring you to manually share this data during your conversation.
